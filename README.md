This tutorial shows how to examine the Coma cluster of galaxies using data and tools of the Virtual Observatory.

It is based on the EURO-VO tutorial (http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials) by
Massimo Ramella & Giulia Iafrate (INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste), later updated by Caroline Bot,
Thomas Boch, Jenny G. Sorce and Katharina A. Lutz, Stefania Amodeo (all CDS, CNRS, Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg).

This version is updated for the 5th Cosmology school in July 2022 and includes state-of-the-art software and data.
